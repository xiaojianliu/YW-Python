Track_Drift
=============
There are three main programs as below:

--"bathymetrypoint.py" mainly employed to plot the bathymetry line and according the line get the contour points,then plot these points on same map.

--"distance.py" seperates  drift tracks into two-days long period and calculate the mean distance/std and mean of mean/std for each part.

--'distanceplot.py' plot the distance figure,x-axis is day(2days) and y-axis is distance(km).

--"collection.py" can help us choose some drifts which meet conditions(floating time/start time)

--"trackdrift.py" can get the model track according particular position/time period.

--"mapdrift.py"according the npy arrange data from "trackdrift.py" to plot a track map.

--"comparedrift.py" plot a map show the difference between model and observe drift data.

--"mapdrifttrack.py" can plot the drift track roughly according to the point you click on map
 
--"getcirclepoint.py" can get the point on concentric. 

--"circletrack.py" can get the concentric points tracks,source is website data.

--'diskcircletrack.py' can get the concentric points tracks,source is disk data
