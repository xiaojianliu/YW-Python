=============
There are three main programs as below:

--"collection.py" can help us choose some drifts which meet conditions(floating time/start time)

--"trackdrift.py" can get the model track according particular position/time period.

--"mapdrift.py"according the npy arrange data from "trackdrift.py" to plot a track map.

--"comparedrift.py" plot a map show the difference between model and observe drift data.

--"mapdrifttrack.py" can plot the drift track roughly according to the point you click on map
