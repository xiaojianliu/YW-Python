Visualization Tool
====================

--"trackzoomin_surface.py" mainly employed to plot different model(30yr/massbay) surface track on a map. 

  First you right-click mouse to zoom in the picture, second you left-click mouse to choose a particular point for track.

--"trackzoomin_verticalvelocity.py" can plot different models track (have U,V,W verlocity) on a map.

--"ctrl_trackzoomin.csv" is the control file for "trackzoomin.py" and "trackzoomin_verticalvelocity.py"

--"temsalmod.py" can show different models(massbay/30yr) temprature and salinity data as a contour figure.

--"temsalmodmap.py" can show different models(massbay/30yr) temprature and salinity data as a contour figure on a geography map.

--"ctrl_temsalmod.csv" is the control file for "temsalmod.py" and "temsalmodmap.py"

--"uvmodel.py" employed to calculate different models bin velosity.

--"ctrl_uvmodel.csv"is the control file for "uvmodel.py"

--"samepoint_trackploy_surface.py" is a test program to get a particular point surface track,its result mainly to compare with the result of "trackzoomin_verticalvelocity.py"
